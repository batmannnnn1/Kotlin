/*
A sealed class is used when you need a hierarchy of types
that are related but can have different properties.
Itâ€™s like having a parent type with several specific subtypes.

Use for a group of related types with possibly different properties.
Example: Different shapes in a drawing app (circle, rectangle, triangle).

              SUMMARY

 use enum class when you have a limited number of fixed options,
and use sealed class when you need to represent a group of related types that can have different properties.
